Summary: 
The Stanford Public Interest Technology (PIT) Lab worked with the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project (AEMP) team to addressing the Bay Area's eviction crisis, which exacerbates homelessness and gentrification. Our project centers on developing automated web scrapers for AEMP’s evictorbook.com, a tool aimed at identifying serial evictors and making property ownership more transparent. By leveraging data scraping techniques, our tools collect and transfer eviction data from county records to AEMP’s system, allowing resources to shift from manual data gathering to landlord accountability efforts. With a prototype ready for Alameda and Contra Costa County and plans for expansion to other counties, we hope to foster housing justice for all.
